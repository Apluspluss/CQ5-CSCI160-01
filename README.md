Runtime and space analysis for Mars exploration problem:

The runtime complexity of the algorithm is O(n), with n representing the length of the string s. The loop runs n/3 times with the substring function and incrementations of result within it being constant work, thus n/3 is the dominant term, which gives us a runtime complexity of O(n).

The space complexity is also O(n) because the algorithm only needs to store the string s, an integer, and a substring of 3 characters for each iteration. The length of the string, n, is the dominant term since the integer and the substring take up constant storage regardless of n, thus the space complexity is O(n).
